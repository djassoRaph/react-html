# react-html

Hi, this is just going to be a react page for my personal web server. 
I have nothing to hide so here's everything, including my mental notes and research on this stuff.


I've been working on php for some time but if I want to "make it" in the dev world. 
In 2021 over half of the applications are in React. 
Go figure, so this is going to be a react web page.

Enjoy.
