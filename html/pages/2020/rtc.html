        <p>I've observed people take action & bring solutions to their local populations.</p>

        <h2>Thoughts.</h2>
        <p>Pillars to help mankind...</p>
        <p>After observing our recent archeological discoveries, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe">Gobekli Tepe</a>, pillars with symbols.</p>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Gobekli_Tepe_2.jpg/800px-Gobekli_Tepe_2.jpg">
        <p>Once humanity was able to leave their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux">caves</a> and set out to discover distant lands, means of communication had been set up</p>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Lascaux%2C_Megaloceros.jpg/1024px-Lascaux%2C_Megaloceros.jpg">
        <p>The people of the land would <a href="https://youtu.be/4F7rLVkwuIs?t=91">shout</a>, 
            scream and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5ZMGBz8qgI" title="1965" >whistle</a> to eachother. </p>
        <p>Their lives would go on untill the telegraph and téléphone arrived.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Idea/Solution</h2>
        <p>I think it'd be nice if people sought to help one another again, without asking for anything in return, directly.</p>
        <p>As before we had pillars to guide what the group of humans needed for their community.</p>
        <p>At one point I thought of even making sky ballons to call populations closer to the "helper event"</p>
        <p>It is time to build new pillars to guide and organise those who wish to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">share</a> and build together.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>An international platform funded by all countries, without any advertisement.</h3>
        <p>A united nations of internet...</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> I have seen how humanity can come together and by way of aligning stars in the sky, they can make anything possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>I thought it'd be good to list things that could be done to help the communities. </p>
        <p>A simple app that allows you to list a problem such as</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>No Funding</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>No Food</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>No clean water</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>No Electricity</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>No school</p> - Proper education
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>No local events</p> - sought to bring the community together
            </li>
            <li>
                And so on.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>We have over produced N times over what our species needs right now to survive.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>We have published quantity of knowledge out into the internet.</p>
        <p>Available for nearly everyone.</p>
        <p>We have sent people to space.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Stop being an NPC head out there and help.</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> So here's the idea : <br>
            List out where something needs to be done,</p>
            <p>Just how reddit's community has helped eachother over the internet. <br> How sailors help eachother, because life at sea is hard</p>
        <p> People available will go and help.</p> <p>How people of a same nation help eachother out when in forgein land.</p>

        <p>Build an educational center, that includes music, sports, art, </p>
